        <p>This Webpage is dedicated to showing off the different projects and assignments that I will be completing throughout the entire CS106 course that I am taking at<br>
            URI. Some of the projects will include different small scale games and apps that we will be creating using javascript as well as some other pages and projects<br>
            that we will be using Javascript for. The class is taught by Mr. Wolfe and lasts 10 weeks. In that time we will be learing basic and more in depth tools to<br>
            programming using Java and HTML and how to style these programs using CSS.</p>
